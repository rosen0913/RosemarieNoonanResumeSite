  <p1 class="body"> As soon as I graduated from high school I immediately started college at MVCC. In the beginning, my focus was on everything Cisco. Topologies, infrastructure, troubleshooting, and software. Due to my desire for a more broadened 
      skill set and background, I switched focus to Information Technology. Since then, the classes I took at Moraine Valley touched on topics including, computer hardware, software, network Infrastructures of both enterprise and personal networks, 
      ethical hacking, digital forensics, Linux, information security, networking protocols, Windows Servers, Virtualization, and Project Management. I transferred from Moraine Valley Community College after the completion of the Fall 2020 semester 
      with a 3.78 GPA and an Associatesâ€™s Degree in General Studies.
