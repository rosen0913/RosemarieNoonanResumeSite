  <h3 class="card-title" align-items="center"> Safety Sweep & Package Handler, United Parcel Service (UPS) August 2019 - May 2021
</h3>

  <p1 class="body"> During my time at UPS, I obtained the role of Safety Sweep after an accident at the workplace that rendered me a trip to the clinic. A set of rollers was dropped and rolled over 
    my finger causing me to almost lose my middle finger on my right hand and took months of recovery, and wearing a splint. After the tragic incident, I inspired and decided from that day on, to become a 
    safety advocate about the dangers of the workplace. As a safety sweep my primary roles included educating my fellow coworkers on the best safety practices, and encouraging them 
    on why following them was so important. Another part of the job was encouraging teamwork and providing such to any worker in need. The role itself also included safety board meetings where injury
     metrics were reviewed and monthly safety topics were discussed and were often followed by audits of equipment upkeep and safety in designated areas. The result was fostering a safety-conscious 
     work environment in both the physical area and in each coworkerâ€™s mindset. 
<br><br>
    As a package handler at UPS, work conditions were very hectic, noisy, and face-paced. The result of working in such an environment helped me adapt skills of teamwork, working under stressful and 
    face-paced work conditions, multitasking, and communication.

  <h3 class="card-title" align-items="center"> Consultation Agent, Geek Squad/Best Buy October 2018 - November 2019
</h3>


  <p1 class="body"> Best Buy was my first job in the technology field. Through my time at Best Buy I adopted the skills of explaining complex technology in a comprehensible context  for my clients. The 
    role also taught me  teamwork, patience,and the best practices for customer service traits. As a consultation agent included diagnosing customer devices 
    which mainly consisted of hardware and software issues on personal computers, mobile phones, and printers. My diagnosis skills were from both personal experience and industry troubleshooting tools. 
    The diversity of customers also taught me sales techniques, that came from understanding what the customers needed and making all my decisions based on person-to-person conversations on what each 
    customer would need, and not overselling them things they would find incompatible with their different lifestyles.
